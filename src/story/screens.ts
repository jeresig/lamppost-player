 * The screens available to the user. These are displayed in the sidebar
 * and in the header (on mobile).
 *
 * There are two built-in screens: "Game" and "History".
 * Those must have the id of "game" and "history", respectively,
 * but can have custom titles. The only required screen is "Game".
 *
 * You can reorder the screens however you like, the first listed screen
 * will be shown to the user by default.
 *
 * You can also add custom screens by providing a component. The component
 * will be rendered in a tab, and can be any valid React component.
 *
 * The component is provided with the following props:
 * - setPage: A function to navigate to a different screen
 * - loading: A boolean indicating if the game is loading
